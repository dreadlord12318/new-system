                            <h3 class="font-bold">Indemnity</h3>
                            <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless for any claims by you or any third party
                                which may arise from or relate
                                to this Agreement or the provision of any of our Services to you, including any damages
                                caused by your use of our Site or Service,
                                or by your breach of this Agreement. You also agree that you must defend us against such
                                claims, and we may require you to pay for an attorney(s) of your choice in such cases.
                                You agree that this indemnity extends to requiring you to pay for our reasonable
                                attorneys’ fees, court costs, and disbursements. In the event of a claim such as one
                                described in this paragraph, we may elect to settle with the party/parties making a
                                claim, and you shall be liable for the damages as though we had proceeded with a trial.
